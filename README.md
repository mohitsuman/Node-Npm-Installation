# Node-Npm-Installation
Node JS / NPM have become essential parts of many applications.

Because of this, and my recent experience with Node, I have decided to compile some instructions on how to install NodeJS/NPM installation [ so that you do not require the sudo command]. 

Installing With NVM
--------------------
// Error arsing due to node not present

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.12.1/install.sh | bash

source ~/.profile

nvm install [version-no]  // latest version can be found at http://nodejs.org/

node -v  [check the version of node installed]

npm -v   [check the version of npm installed]

Go To the project and  install all dependencies in package.json

$ npm install

===============================================================================================

Grunt Task Runner
-----------------
npm install -g grunt-cli

[ Install ruby and gem install sass]

Bower
-----------------
npm install -g bower
